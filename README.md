# BlackJack
OOP practice

## Deck.py
* Handles playing cards 
* Stores cards in embedded list, aces given extra element for scoring high or low
* Returns cards at random from deck, removes them from deck so can't be drawn again

## Main.py
* Handles game logic
* Initialises other classes, holds twist logic
* Checks for outcome vs computer

## Player.py
* Player has a hand and score
* Cards are dealt to start and added to hand if we twist
* Score is calculated, if over 21 we check for aces and change to low, until score is under 21
